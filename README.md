# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console


~ Python

~ OOP



~ My Objective:

To develop a basic command-line interface (CLI) to manage a simplified version of an AirBnB-like platform. This console will serve as the foundation for a more comprehensive platform.

Key Features:

Data Model: Define and implement a data model to represent various entities like users, listings, and reservations.
Command Interpreter: Develop a command-line interface to interact with the data model, allowing users to create, update, delete, and view data.
Data Persistence: Store and retrieve data using a JSON file format.
Command Interpreter:

The command interpreter will be a library written in C that provides a command-line interface. It will:

Accept user input in the form of commands.
Process and execute these commands.
Interact with the data model to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Use:

Start the Interpreter: Launch the command interpreter application.
Enter Commands: Type commands at the prompt to interact with the system.
Execute Commands: Press Enter to execute each command.

By building this simplified console, I will lay the groundwork for a more complex web application with a user-friendly interface.
